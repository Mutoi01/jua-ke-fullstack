#               He had never been with a woman before and he had not even much enjoyed
#               the company of females at all.

#               His mother was a single never married biddy who scowled at everything. It
#               was a wonder to him that she stopped scowling long enough to take off her
#               clothes and ger pregnant. For all the bile she exhibited to the make gender
#               her mused that he might have been the product of rape. What his mother
#               gave in hatred for men he repaid two-fold in discomfiture with women.

#               At age Twenty-Five, he was still a virgin, an addict in the modern age, but
#               one he paid little if any heed. He often contemplated having paid for sex but
#               could not be bothered to find time and safe circumstances to give it a try.
#               Now halfway drunk in a shebeen he did not too much care for, a hard drinking
#               and smoking lassie was giving him the eye. For one so not into the vibe, it
#               was a wonder that the was aware that what he was receiving was 'the eye'.
#               That it was the eye he was pretty sure it was. It was mesmerizing. He found
#               himself discretely getting hard, in his trousers. 'So, this is it? This is how
#               people feel when they know they are gonna get laid'.

#               'Wait a minute, I haven't even spoken to the lady. How do I know am getting
#               laid? A bottle of rum later and a precarious taxi ride to the pharmacy to pick
#               up condoms, they were awkwardly kicking off shoes outside his puny
#               apartment. Undressing was hurried, tangled, confused eventually over with.
#               No moments off reflection or inflection, their bodies spoke one voice, in the
#               language of unadulterated lust.

#               She could not believe it when he told her between rounds of intense, manic
#               love making that he was a virgin. They ran out of condoms before they ran
#               out of steam. Still the fleeting thought did come, one of a lifetime of nanseting
#               medicaments on account of a momentary lapse in judgment nice as the first
#               time had been, it was not going to be worth getting sick over. She was not
#               annoyed. She was struck with how careful he was.

#               She dressed up and skipped her bra. She donated a strap to him as a
#               keepsake. Left her number on the T.V in case he thought they should hook
#               up again. Three months later, she was pregnant and already hating his guts.
#               'I did not ask for this. I always insisted on protection, why weren't you on
#               contraception?' Five months after the baby was born, she walked out never
#               to return.

#               There was a slight issue of maintaining a child, but he had just lost a job and
#               pretty soon moved 500kms away to Mombasa. 'I never liked women, one
#               almost just destroyed my life before I even knew what my life was'. It was a
#               full two years before he even allowed himself to get laid again.

#               The second one was a mystery. His mums only sister was not his favorite
#               person on the planet. She complained about everything. She was unhappy
#               at the hearing of age thirty there was no woman rumored to be his life. She
#               was upset when he quit his job to start a business and was mightily mad that
#               he owned a car and not a house.

#               It was a big surprise then that he fell to her machinations with eyes wide
#               open. His aunt in Nairobi often found it to be her business to hunt and gather
#               food stuff from up country and give it all to this fine-looking lass to deliver to
#               him in Mombasa. One had to wonder if his aunt thought there was no
#               foodstuff to be had in Mombasa, or why a particular girl had to play
#               messenger.

#               When he first slept with her, it was to get back at his aunt. By the time he
#               was losing count of the number, he already liked the convenience of having
#               someone cook for him, wash his clothes and clean his house it was a short
#               step to enforce domestication when one weekend she did not budge or make
#               a move when Monday arrived. Three weeks in a row and playing domestic
#               had caught. He had to seek her permission to go lit of a drink. It was a bitter
#               sweet catch 22. One he was in no particular hurry to get out of her long
#               sojourns to Nairobi left him enough time to be free and the conveniences
#               when she was around outmatched any reservations that he had.",

#               No one is ready not sure where the booty traps set. It is the girls stupid! Too
#               gang no! is a cause for concern, they do tend to be clingy long after the
#               Jonnies are back to the hard work. The potential for sneak photograph they
#               after used to blackmail the respectable seniors is another.

#               The unexpected however is the demure, quiet types. Reluctant drinkers with
#               naivete written all over them. The torrid suggestion is that there may be some
#               virgins in the crew.

#               While a thrill on account of the quintessential chase, they are the biggest risk
#               yet some have been heard to speak of latex intolerance, a naked invitation
#               to let one's guard down.

#               In the short order the nascent pro-lifer is protesting that an innocent life
#               needs protecting. After days of being nice (read) monetary bribes, there is an-
#               acquiesce of termination Big bucks' termination and the attendant after bribe
#               complete with the ever-present threat of exposure. 'We once did trip and
#               then aborted the mission' the documentation can hardly be more complete
#               if it was your tax returns.

#               The sensible second brother in the trio is hardly any luckier despite being
#               more sensible. Takes at face value that the naive sweet thing he is been
#               assigned is on an allegorical trip to the red planet You wonder what rainfall

#               The sweet innocent media practitioner is soon out with it claiming sexual

#               through out to have been unwelcome.

#               The touching inappropriate, the suggestion of a consensual roll in the hay
#               most unwelcome especially considering the proponent seniority in society.
#               This last one is a laugh. At no time have I ever thought a politician is a senior
#               at anything.

#               Seems I was wrong all the while apparently a politician can get a girl to drop
#               her pants against her will by shear force of votes. It is going to take some

#               voting give you any right or does it make you the unwilling unwitting
#               automation.

#               Let's start at the bottom. Electing an MCA (member of county Assembly) to
#               represent 10,000 or more people in a geographical area they have absolutely
#               no say in determining Some of the voters would rather be in a different ward
#               where service delivery is better. You do not choose the candidates, the party
#               or the area.

#               The idiot you like the least is some kind of comedic flirt. He gets all the ladies
#               wet literally. They give him the vote on some misguided notion of sex appeal.
#               He will philander well, but not to the extent of the entire ward. Many broken
#               hearts, illegitimate children and possibly a bad disease later, reasonable
#               constituents are lamenting but unable to do much. The village idiots are also
#               running for election and surprise, surprise, his chances are good.

#               No problem there, but consider this, the fabled three arms of government
#               constitute two that are not elected!

#               Two thirds of the government is unelected. The elected third is too enamored
#               with itself, it spends a considerable part of each day prancing in front of a
#               mirror reciting how powerful it thinks it is. The rest of the time is shared
#               equally in seduction of every possible paramour it can attempt to assert and
#               prove virility and bootlicking of betters.

#               Law making is what the job describes, but with a clique so impressed with
#               itself and so immersed in exceptionalism, which laws may the law makers
#               obey? They may vote of legislation that affect the minions but half the time
#               their gaze is distracted by the next glitzy thing. A fuel guzzling behemoth to
#               firmly place a ruler on the genitals or a semi naked camera crazed female.
#               All in a day's works for waheshimiwa.

#               If you want to know that you have no vote, look at what you disagree with in
#               any enterprise run by the government. Now tweet, Facebook, email yourself
#               to a frenzy. Get people who agree with you to voice the same concern. At
#               best your concern may trend for a few hours and be promptly ignored. At

#               or even why. I did entertain a lot of doubts throughout that phase. Finally, the
#               doubts won. There was no way I'd be satisfied with answer like 'God works
#               in mysterious ways' or 'that is beyond human knowledge'.

#               I was perplexed by the admonishment when I asked who created God and I
#               was told that that is a blasphemous question.

#               I live without faith and I am great for the most part. When I want anything, I
#               craft ways and means to get it. I do not pray for it. I have ample evidence
#               that prayer does not work. It mesmerizing to see the contortion Christians
#               especially go through in their abusive romance with their God.

#               A loved one gets sick. They pray for his healing. He gets well through the
#               efforts of the medical personnel as well as the medicine. They can't seem to
#               shut up about the boundless mercy and love that brought healing. A few
#               months later, a different loved one gets sick and after much prayer in the
#               same fashion and zest, he dies. The story changes, it is not mercy, love and
#               healing now!! Its 'mysterious ways, Gods will and God had a good reason that
#               we may not know' or even the ultimate. 'God wants to show us how much he
#               loves us'.

#               One guy lives, God loves him. Another guy dies, well God loves us! Speaking
#               from both sides of the mouth is something Christians have mastered. I got
#               my head spinning in so many directions that the only way to stop the
#               dizziness was to get out.

#               For me a guy gets sick and lives, it is wonders of modern medicine. He dies,
#               it is the end of a cycle. It is bound to happen at some point in each life. There
#               is no particular significance it is a very short trip to decomposition and
#               providing nutrients to insect maggots and plant forms. It is sad for friends
#               and relatives but eventually it passes. A mother losing a child in the first
#               century B.C cried her heart out in devastation. They are both dead two
#               thousand plus year and their genetic trace impossible to find today.

#               So, I wonder how to grieve without faith. The biological order gives me
#               comfort I can share this with friends and relatives grieving with me. They
#               more often than not chose faith. I find it hard to participate but am non the
#               less compelled to play along. Taking off my hat and mumbling
#               incomprehensible in the name of prayer. Eventually I will chorus with
#               everyone else an 'Amen' that I neither feel nor recognize the most tiresome
#               thing is when friends and family who know of my Atheistic convictions start
#               insinuating that 'I am still a believer or that I will soon be rejoining them'.

#               The take away from such experiences is always that this Christian belief

#               laboring under the misapprehension that they can preach and should preach.

#     content: "For a great many years, the principal manufacturer of corned beef in Kenya
#               was the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) As names go it's a pretty draft one
#               Why processing meat requires a commission sounds a lot like the stupid
#               boardroom discussions that kills, slaughters and quarters a prime angus bull
#               by sheer force of bureaucracy I disgress, forgive me. I want to do that
#               several times in this piece.

#               The principal consumer of the fine's product of the commissions the
#               venerated comed beef, is the Kenya Military.Things have gone full circle
#               these days, it's the selfsame Military running the show at the Kenya Meat
#               Commission (KMC).

#               So back to corned beef, all of 27 years since old Mutiso has been dead of
#               severe dismembement at the Commission, me and corned beef are not
#               friends. See Mutiso was this expressive kind, who never thought you quite
#               got the gist of his argument if he wasn't gesticulating wildly. He was also
#               comically demonstrative. The secret joke behind his back was that he would
#               actually get fellas homy by only telling them of an escapade with a willing
#               female Kamba dancer. A hug, a kiss loud wet and suggestive right before a
#               thrust of him that left little to the imagination.

#               Mutiso was in the middle of telling a lewd story that had the use of fingers
#               being inserted suggestively in parts of the anatomy best left to the
#               imagination, when the selfsame middle finger got caught in an industrial
#               grade meat grinder. For a few seconds all present thought the yelp of pain
#               from Mutiso was his usual dramatics when telling a lewd tale. It got more
#               qufural and shriller at the same time and caught every one's attention. By
#               the time the machine was turned off, the grinding desiccation and general
#               pulping off flesh was almost at Mutiso's elbow.

#               The processing plant did not blink or stop on account of a malfunction of just
#               one grinder. The addition of corn starch, spices and tinning continued an
#               booted. From that batch a few grammes of Mutiso peppered the corned beef
#               product. While it went off to some supermarket shelf or to a Military quarter
#               master store. Poor Mutiso did not make it. He bled out half way to his expiry
#               on a hot, dry Athi river floor with the distinctive odor of warm offal cloying his
#               nostrils.

#               Government types, especially parastatal bureaucracy is the lot least likely to
#               admit malfeasance anywhere in the planet. From the line managers, plant
#               supervisors and eventually the directors none had any qualms in letting the
#               good soldiers get fat off the fat of Mutiso's hand. No one would even admit
#               anything other than unfortunate accident.

#               Now the consternation when in pursuit of affordable alcohol and thus
#               happiness, my friends and I staggered to a shooting range in the vicinity of
#               the factory where the boys from the barracks often come to burst caps. The
#               alcohol is certified AFCO and therefore at the price denied poor citizens who's
#               taxes pay the deranged soldiers. Long story short, I went into
#               hyperventilation when one soldier in the guise of being nice offered me a tin
#               of corned beef. My brain, bursting with fecundity, two weeks after burying
#               Mutiso actually read the words 'Mutiso flavored' in place the label indicated
#               'with black pepper'. My colleagues declined on my behalf and as a
#               consolation tried to drown me in alcohol I had darkly macabre nightmares
#               for months after the event.

#               Every portly soldier I have encountered since, appears to have been
#               nourished with Mutiso flavored corned beef. For the life of me, I can never
#               quite figure why it is even necessary to put maize or any of its product in
#               beef. Maize is always the visible edifice of Githeri, the despicable stapple
#               of the downtrodden. If you dropped a fistful of bean in a 100kgs of maize,
#               you have Githeri right there Food for prisoners students, slaves!

#               How then did they figure they can and could incorporate half Githeri into
#               ground meat? How is such food even to be nice? Ultimate the risk is not one
#               of nourishment or lack thereof, it is one of deranged soldiers on hair triggers
#               surviving on a sustenance of slave food. Mutiso flavored slave food.

#               Cows in Europe fed on some aspects of animal protein did develop an
#               encephalopathy known widely as mad cow disease I stand in owe how one
#               of these pot-bellied soldiers has now developed a madness out of eating
#               'Mutiso flavored' Githeri meat.

#               I did notice in one of the commanders of General staff A big Kahuna in the
#               military who seemed to prefer his 'Mutiso' whole for the size of the gut on
#               the man. A proliferation of Mutiso eaters seems to have suddenly hit the
#               Military even at the lower ranks. That many years after leaving the Athi River
#               Factory, who knows a whole 'Mutiso' may be the flavor of the day.

#               That's why, my brothers and sisters, I dare not for the life of me put a morse!
#               of comed in my mouth. You'd have to kill me first.",
